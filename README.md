Deployed in Vercel: https://incard-login.vercel.app/
Mimiced basic design from: https://www.incard.co/

Primary objectives:

- Practice creating (login) forms.
- Session persistence and expiration.

Requirements:

- It should consist of at least two pages - the login and a home page.
- It should be functional e.g. login should take users to the home page - use 'incard' for username and password.
- It should Handle errors e.g. if incorrect details were entered or session has expired.
- The session should be persistent e.g. on page reload the user should not be taken back to the login page. If the session has expired then they should be redirected back to the login page.
- It would be nice to support SSR.
- Create 2-3 unit tests.
- Deploy the app to Netlify.
